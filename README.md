# Title of the game : Heavy Lies the Crown. 
 
This game is based on my love for fantasy-fiction both in English and 
my native language Tamil. The game puts forth few scenarios where a king
must make decisions without much information.
Room 1: Small introduction 
Room 2: Choice between Battle and Consulting the Oracle
Room 3: The Temple
Room 4: Opening the Snake Chamber
Some unknown terms you might face:
Yazhi: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yali_(mythology)
Rudraveena: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudra_veena
Mantra: is a chant or a slogan.

Since the story aspect is heavy, the player might get confused while scrolling
down. I have added '---' lines to make the story more readable. Not aware of any other bugs.
